# .NET Backend Engineer Roadmap

A structured 12-month curriculum to take motivated junior .NET developers to solid mid-level competence.

## Who This Is For

You should use this roadmap if you:
- Can write basic C# (variables, loops, classes, methods)
- Have built something (a tutorial project, side project, anything)
- Know Git basics (clone, commit, push)
- Want to become a mid-level backend engineer, not just collect certifications

## How It Works

1. **One project throughout** - You'll build [OrderFlow](./modules/00-introduction/SAMPLE-PROJECT.md), an order management system that grows in complexity across all modules
2. **Learn the "why"** - Each module explains what goes wrong without the knowledge, not just the mechanics
3. **Prove it with deliverables** - Working code, documentation, benchmarks that mentors can review

## Quick Start

1. Take the [Self-Assessment](./modules/00-introduction/SELF-ASSESSMENT.md) to find your starting point
2. Read the [Introduction](./modules/00-introduction/README.md) to understand the approach
3. Review [OrderFlow](./modules/00-introduction/SAMPLE-PROJECT.md) - the project you'll build
4. Bookmark the [Resources](./modules/00-introduction/RESOURCES.md) for reference
5. Start with the module your assessment identified (or [Module 01](./modules/01-csharp-foundations/README.md) if unsure)
